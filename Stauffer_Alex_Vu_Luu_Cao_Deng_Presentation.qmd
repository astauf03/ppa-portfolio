# Philadelphia Housing Price Prediction

**The Question:** What data do we have on property, the Census, and built environment that can help predict housing prices?

**The Motivation:** Philadelphia is a city of more than 1.5 million people and growing, we need properties to be accurately assessed.

## The Problem & The Goal

### Why This Matters

Improving the Office of Property Assessment's Automated Valuation Model (AVM) can potentially:

- **More stable values aligned with market rates** for properties being sold.

- **Alleviate burden from gentrification** in previously disinvested neighborhoods.

---

## The Problem & The Goal

### What We Want

- **Equitable taxation** for residents.

- **Financial stability** for Philadelphia.

- Help set the future for **more reliable open data**.

# Data Overview

[Philadelphia Properties and Current Assessments from Open Data Philly](https://metadata.phila.gov/#home/datasetdetails/5543865f20583086178c4ee5/representationdetails/55d624fdad35c7e854cb21a4/) *(n = 559,322)*

- **Property Coordinates**, **Sale Date** *(n = 34,559; 2023-2024)*, **Sale Price** *(> $10,000; n = 26,344)*, **Property Characteristics:** bathrooms, basement type, central air, fireplaces, fuel type, garages, square feet, stories, year built *(n = 18,221)*

[2023 5-Year American Community Survey (ACS) from the United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/news/updates/2023.html) *(n = 28,261; 2019-2023)*

- **Median Household Income**, **Single-Family Detached Homes**, **Vacancies** *(n = 3,401)*

# Data Overview

[Open Data Philly](https://opendataphilly.org/)

- **Neighborhood Boundaries** *(n = 159; 2025)*, **Parks** *(n = 15; 2025)*, **Philadelphia 2020 Census Tract Boundaries** *(n = 3,446; 2020)*, **SEPTA Transit Stations** *(n = 13,884; 2025)*

[Open Street Maps](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmdata/vignettes/osmdata.html)

- **Points of Interest:** Convenience and Food-Related Amenities *(n = 18,413; 2025)*

## Where Are Expensive Homes?

## Findings

- **Higher Prices:** Center City, University City, the riverfront, and affluent Northwest pockets.

- Potentially due to **easy access** to transit and amenities.

- **Lower Prices:** North of Broad Street into parts of West and North Philadelphia.

- Potentially reflecting **long-term disinvestment**.

- **Sale price is place-dependent in Philadelphia, mostly due to neighborhood qualities.**

## What Drives Prices?

![](slide_images\price-v-sqft.png){width=70%}
:::

- **Larger homes = an increase in price**, but only up to a certain point.

## Model Comparison & Performance

![](slide_images\kable-model.png){width=40%}

- **RMSE = 138,279.40** → Predicted sale price differs by about ± $138,279 from actual market sale price.

- **R² = 0.746** → Explains 75% of variance in home prices.

# Top Predictors

- Neighborhoods (e.g. Fitler Square $431,911.65 > East Falls)

- Livable Square Footage ($187.32 increase)

- Median Household Income ($0.63 increase)

## Hardest To Predict

# Conclusions & Recommendations

**Human review for over-valued neighborhoods that are being gentrified.**

# Limitations & Next Steps

**Limitations / Ethical Concerns:**

- Undervalues some disinvested neighborhoods and overvalues wealthier ones.

- Areas with residents depend more on personal vehicles, this model is predicting on public transit, not highways.

**Future Potential:**

- Incorporate additional categorical variables after consideration.

- Separate rural modeling can be helpful too.
